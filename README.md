MATLABÂ® combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and design 
processes with a programming language that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly



* __Interpolation__ - in the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

* __Approximation__ - in mathematics, approximation theory is concerned with how functions can best be approximated with simpler functions.

* __Numerical Differentiation__ numerical differentiation describes algorithms for estimating the derivative of a mathematical function or function subroutine using values of the function.

* __Numerical Integration__  method based on the approximate calculation of definite integrals

* __Bisection__ - one of the methods of solving nonlinear equations.

* __Falsi rule__ - an algorithm for solving nonlinear equations of one variable.
